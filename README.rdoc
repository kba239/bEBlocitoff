Blocitoff

Blocitoff is a self-destructing to-do list application.

Users can:
* Create an account
* Sign in and out
* Update their account
* Create to-do list items.

Items delete after 7 days, so that your to do list doesn't get cluttered and out-of-date.

It uses Ruby on Rails, Devise, Faker, and Bootstrap.
